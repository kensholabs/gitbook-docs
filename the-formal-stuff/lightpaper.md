### Introduction

KAROSHI is the genesis collection, consisting of 10000 Ninjas and Samurais with over 200 individual traits. We are a Web 3.0 brand that makes social impact by building the right things, creating a synergy between technology and people, raising awareness about modern problems, and are passionate about what we are doing. Our goal is to build a community and give that community a way to represent itself online. We don't want to copy any successful projects, instead we are going to take another way.

### Background

NFT's should be about artists and creators. It SHOULD be, but in the current market it isn't. From the first NFT drops until now we've seen a lot going on and the path is pretty clear. Artists get a cut, or worse their art is even stolen and in the end, whoever markets itself best wins. And there's nothing wrong with marketing a project, and we're not dismissing marketing, it is important. The wrong part is only marketing and not delivering.
