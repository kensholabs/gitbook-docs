### Introduction

KAROSHI is the genesis collection, consisting of 10000 Ninjas and Samurais with over 200 individual traits. We are a Web 3.0 brand that makes social impact by building the right things, creating a synergy between technology and people, raising awareness about modern problems, and are passionate about what we are doing. Our goal is to build a community and give that community a way to represent itself online. We don't want to copy any successful projects, instead we are going to take another way.
