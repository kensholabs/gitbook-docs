### Introduction

KAROSHI is the genesis collection, consisting of 10000 Ninjas and Samurais with over 200 individual traits. We are a Web 3.0 brand that makes social impact by building the right things, creating a synergy between technology and people, raising awareness about modern problems, and are passionate about what we are doing. Our goal is to build a community and give that community a way to represent itself online. We don't want to copy any successful projects, instead we are going to take another way.

### Background

NFT's are still in their infancy. The blockchain allows enables us to prove the authenticity and uniqueness of the content but besides that there are a lot of technologies being developed around it to explore their full potential. There is no standard framework to guide the creators, also there is no easy way to apply it for every type of artwork or use case. Even though blockchains help a lot at cutting cost and lowering barriers to entry and making, it is not that user friendly, and this slows adoption. Because of that, our goal is to make technology simple to use and effective at achieving our goals and enabling people do what they are good at, making the world more fair.

The waters are just yet being tested and a lot innovation must take place until we come to a great way of monetizing and licensing content based on its applications. NFT's are hard. They are hard because people didn't figure out all of it yet.  Music NFT's are even harder. The music industry is still trying to figure out how to best use NFT's. Some believe that they could be used to sell digital music, while others believe that they could be used to sell access to exclusive content or experiences. We know for sure that artists want their music to reach their audience and also get them a bigger cut of the pie. Content is consumed differently now, also there are lots of types of content. There's no solution to fit it all, there probably will never be. For achieving this goal, we need to build an open protocol, a framework that will enable content creators to share, transact, licence and aggregate talent. You can't expect everyone to buy every song they listen and monthly subscriptions are also not better at paying artists. If you want to change the way people pay for music, you need to change the way music is distributed and licensed. And artists should choose themselves how and how much they want to get paid for their work.

NFT's should be about artists and creators. It SHOULD be, but in the current market it isn't. From the first NFT drops until now we've seen a lot going on and the path is pretty clear. Artists get a cut, or even worse their art is stolen and in the end, whoever markets itself the best wins. From understanding the problems, we can start building a solution, not the other way around. The wrong part is only marketing and not delivering. And there's nothing wrong with marketing a project, and we're not dismissing marketing, it is important. The NFT space nowadays is flooded with content but not with artists. Most of the content creators are not artists, they are just people who are looking to make a quick buck by creating an NFT. We need to change that! The majority of people who are buying NFTs are speculators and investors, not collectors or fans. This is a problem because it means that the NFT space is becoming a playground for those who are only interested in making a quick buck, not for those who are interested in supporting artists and the creative process.

If the NFT space is going to survive and thrive in the long run, it needs to attract more artists. It needs to be a space where artists feel welcomed and supported, not a space where they feel like theyâ€™re being taken advantage of.
