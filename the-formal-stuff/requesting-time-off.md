# Roadmap

In this space everyone screams UTILITY and community and then lay off a shitty bullet point roadmap that no one needs. Why? It’s PR and marketing.Their only purpose is to sell people on the idea of the project, rather than the project itself. Why can’t we just show people what we’re building? Why can’t we just tell people how awesome our idea is and how we’re going to build it? Why does everything have to be so fucking shady and secretive? Is it because they’re all a bunch of scammers? Is it because all these projects are just a pile of shit? Is it because they have no fucking clue of what they're doing? Maybe all three? We just know that we're tired of all this bullshit, of the lies, deception and all the empty promises.

Do they really care about community? It's easy to copy the last working project, bring nothing new to the table and label bullshit as utility, but who wants that? We've seen okay roadmaps, then copy-cats roadmaps, then memes and no roadmaps. Did they succeed? Mostly no! This created a precedent where when you hear utility, you automatically want to turn the other side and run away. We've decided to take a different approach. At the core, we are developers, artists, music producers and much more. We have built a framework for proposals and voting, and we're going to vote on the best ideas and build them. Providing real value is what this space needs. This is how it should be done, this is how we do it!

The community members will choose some some representants who have proven their loyalty to the community to directly participate in the process, increasing the transparency and accountability, doing things the right way.

We will write some things we want to do, but in the end, we will all decide what's best and how we'll do it!
