# Roadmap

In this space everyone screams UTILITY and community and then lay off a shitty bullet point roadmap that no one needs. Do they really care about community? And it's easy to copy the last working project, label bullshit as utility, but who wants that? We've seen okay roadmaps, then copy-cats roadmaps, then memes and no roadmaps. Did they succeed? Mostly no! This created a precedent where when you hear utility, you automatically want to turn the other side and run away. We've decided to take a different approach. At the core, we are developers, artists, music producers and much more. We have built a framework for proposals and voting, and we're going to vote on the best ideas and build them. Providing real value that this space needs. This is how it should be, this is how we do it!

The community members will choose some some representants who have proven their loyalty to the community to directly participate in the process, increasing the transparency and accountability, doing things the right way.

We will write some things we want to do, but in the end, we will all decide what's best and how we'll do it!
