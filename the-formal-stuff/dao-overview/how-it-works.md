# How it works

For the first stage, Kensho Labs founders decided to launch the project as a DAO and split the governance between the core team and community members. A council from the bravest community members will be formed, which will represent the community voices. This is to ensure that we will be able to act fast until the token is released. At  As more people become involved and hold the token, they will be able to participate in the decision making process. The more tokens you hold, the more stake in the DAO you have.
