# How it works

For the first stage, Kensho Labs founders decided to launch the project as a DAO and split the governance between the core team and community members, who can contribute to the project, and vote on the capitalization and development of the project. This was done for a couple reasons: The state of the future of DAO's in the context of US regulatory environment is pretty uncertain, this is why we are Europe based. The second reason is because we come with some solid experience from traditional IT business and we really want to experiment with DAO's and try to fix the problems Web2.0 can't overcome. At the same time, the project will be open for early investors and developers, who will be able to use the platform and participate in the development of new tools and dapps. A council from the bravest community members will be formed, which will represent the community voices. This is to ensure that we will be able to act fast until the token is released. At first, everyone can make proposals and vote on them. The best of them will be selected by the council. After the launch as more people become involved and hold the token, they will be able to participate in the decision making process. The more tokens you hold, the more stake in the DAO you have.
