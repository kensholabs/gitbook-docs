# Vision and Values

## Our Vision

The essential idea of a DAO is to automate all of the agreements needed to coordinate a group of individuals to accomplish the work of an organization â€“ in other words, to replace the centralized overhead of a conventional business with code. Philosophy can also be applied to goal setting and strategy formulation. In general, we believe that it is better to have a simple, clear plan that can be executed quickly and efficiently rather than a complex plan that takes a long time to develop and implement. Some have cautioned that not all decentralized structures are truly autonomous unless control is ceded to code, as opposed to human control.&#x20;

And we have a lot of anti-examples where some actors only use the buzz words without any intention to be truly autonomous nor decentralized. This has brought the crypto space to a point where projects "getting hacked" is the new norm and it's even become normalized. Even though some aspects of a blockchain can be hacked, like smart contracts, wallets, or people through phishing or social engineering, the underlying fundamental are secure and with over a decade of proof. It all comes down to human factor and the use of technology.

Karoshi is a WEB 3.0 brand that makes social impact by building the right things, raising awareness about modern problems, and are passionate about what we are doing. Our goal is to build a community and give that community a way to represent itself online.

We are going to achieve this by providing real utilities that people use, social perks, being transparent with aligned incentives with our holders, making partnerships with established brands and projects and full IP rights to holders. We don't create jpeg's, we create experiences!

Karoshi is truly owned and led by the community, and WAGMI for sure! The question is: Are you going to build with us or you're gonna fomo into the next rug and blame the industry as a whole?

We're not promising you the moon, we're promising you a great journey!

## Our Values



We treat everyone we encounter with compassion, seeing the humanity behind their problems and experiences.

We are not represented by any value in particular, but by all our values as a whole.

Besides the core themes of wu-wei and aligning action in harmony with nature and the laws of the universe, other generally shared values of Taoism include self organization, simplicity, and humility (or not placing oneself either at the center, or above, the order of the universe).

We embrace diversity, in all forms, and celebrate the strength it brings us. We work tirelessly to end the suffering of others, and continue our commitment to doing so. We see the future as a time of hope, and we make every effort to ensure that we can bring about that future together.

To our merit, we managed not only to build an open company but also an underground community around our business. We had the opportunity to meet and connect with people of the same mindset and share the same vision. Vision, not hierarchy is what keeps us together.

We work together to achieve our goals, and we support and respect each other along the way.

We challenge our own and others' assumptions through qualitative and quantitative research. Not sure about an idea? Test it.

We strive for clarity in our understanding of the data and insights we uncover. We bring a fresh perspective through diverse opinions and creativity.
