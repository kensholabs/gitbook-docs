description: HARDCODING ETHICS - The TAO for DAO

# Philosophy

_"The Tao is not something different from nature, from ourselves, from our surrounding trees and waters and air. The Tao is the way all that behaves. And so the basic Chinese idea of the universe is really that it’s an organism.”_ - Alan Watts

Kind of ironic, when examining the Taoist philosophy of "action without deliberation" and drawing some analogies in the business context, we will provoke a mature conversation on the need for having taken a more proactive and thoughtful approach to the law and adopted voluntarily commitments that imply a deeper, broader, more conscious and thoughtful consideration about human values, autonomy and social interaction.

The central tenet of Taoism, wu-wei (traditional Chinese: 無爲, simplified: 无为, pinyin: wú wéi), has been translated to “action without deliberation.” Wei connotes intention or deliberation and wu conveys the meaning of “lacking” or “without,” resulting in the alternative translations “non-action,” “effortless action,” or “action without intent.”

### What is Dao?

In Chinese, the word ‘Tao’, also  means ‘the way’, the force that flows through all life in the universe. It is considered to be the driving force behind everything that exists. The objective of Taoism is for a person to align harmoniously with the ‘Tao’ i.e. to achieve immortality by taking the right path in life. In standard Chinese, the term ‘道’ is pronounced as ‘Tao’ with a tone. However, the same tone cannot be reproduced by most native English speakers, which is why, the term ‘道’ is pronounced as ‘Dao’ by them.

### The modern acronym

A DAO, or “Decentralized Autonomous Organization” is a community-led entity with no central authority. It is fully autonomous and transparent: smart contracts lay the foundational rules, execute the agreed upon decisions, and at any point, proposals, voting, and even the very code itself can be publicly audited.

Ultimately, a DAO is governed entirely by its individual members who collectively make critical decisions about the future of the project, such as technical upgrades and treasury allocations.

### Now what?

Being active members of the crypto space for years now, it's practically impossible not to ask some questions about the state of the industry, about the frustrations and problems DAO's face every day. Taken to an extreme, it is possible to encode all operating rules of a group of individuals, creating an effective and fair DAO, yet very few succeed. Question is why?

The alignment of incentives: No DAO will succeed unless we all  align our goals, and most importantly eliminate the risks with the use of the underlying technology.

Hardcoding the ethics creates an opportunity to think deeply about the impact of these organizations. The practice opens lines of further scholarly and policy debate, including whether and how, through the deliberate encoding of ethical rules we could flip the perceived hierarchy of duties that individuals act upon in practice. In other words, rather than treating ethical issues as secondary to the bedrock obligation to harvest profits even if laws are (profitably) broken and life is (profitably) destroyed, hardcoding ethics presents an opportunity to discuss whether “first, be lawful” or even “first, do no (net) harm” could, in at least some contexts, be encoded as first principles.
