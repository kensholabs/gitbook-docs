# Degen culture

If crypto has taught us anything, it's that we are all degens, whether we want to acknowledge it or not. Degen is not community, degen is a way of life. Whether you are aping into this new hyped project, you get rekt shorting the bottom on 100x leverage, or you became a bagholder waiting for that lambo, you are truly a degen. Degen culture does not try to frame itself as something that it's not. One important similarity with the Taoist way that we can learn is to not fight the human nature, and choose the path of least resistance. As all people do, we might be weak, biased, and make the same mistake multiple times, but if anything - Apes together strong! We think that this authenticity brought us to crypto in the first place, and even though we faced a lot of scammers, we made true friends along the way.&#x20;
