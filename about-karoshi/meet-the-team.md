# Meet the Team!

Navigating through Crypto Twitter, there are plenty of pseudonymous celebrities that, based solely on the reputations they have built, have a digital persona with a substantial amount of followers. They didn't choose to stay anon for no reason, they choose because they finally could do it. And if you look at conventional "celebrities" that got into crypto, they used their status to make money instead of working in the industry. The basis of Web3.0 is digital ownership, including your privacy too.

Crypto makes you vulnerable. A target. Do you want to go on vacation and worry about people breaking into your home looking for seed phrases? Do you want to have kids one day. Think about their safety before they're conceived. The truth is that besides adolescent dreams when some of us wanted to become singers and actors, most people don't like attention and fame. Insecure people want attention. They have an image to maintain. They post on insta all day long and become a prisoners to the lifestyle. There are some brilliant minds on Crypto but humans are human. When people lose arguments, they turn to attack their looks. I could be 700lbs or a soy boy. I could have a nipple growing on my forehead. Being anon means you're judging me 100% for the quality of my thoughts and work.

Will the Mask Come Off? Despite the advantages of being anon, we'll probably end up semi-doxxed one day. Banking as an anon is a pain in the ass and opening shady accounts in the Cayman Islands is no fun as well. And finally, it's stressful trying to keep identity a secret. Making sure camera is off and making sure you're logged into the right accounts. Think of TDE as more of a "Pen name". Kinda like how there were a ton of female writers in the 1980s who chose to go by a different name (mostly men names btw). But some people will eventually find out who you are. And that's ok. Just keep it on the down-low, and understand why you've chosen to remain anon.
