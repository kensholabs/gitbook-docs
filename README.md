# Welcome!

[Kensho Labs](https://kensho-labs.com) is a WEB 2.0 turned WEB 3.0 company that is trying to leverage technology and empowering a community of people into creating a social impact and give that community a way to represent itself online. The ultimate goal of Kensho Labs is to create a more inclusive and decentralized and fair internet where users have more control over their lives and make the world a better place. We are building a social platform that will allow our community to connect, collaborate, and share their knowledge and expertise with the world. Our goal is to make it easy for our community members to find each other, connect, and work together to make a difference.

In this section we will try to give you a glimpse into our philosophy and what pushed us to begin working on KAROSHI and create this community.

Great things are not built in one night. Take the time, decide if you relate to our values and you want to be a part of us.
